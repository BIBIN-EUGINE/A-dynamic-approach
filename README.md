# A-dynamic-approach
In this project me and my project partner implemnted a paper Ultrasound Elastography: A dynamic approach by Prof. Hassan Rivaz.
There is two sections for this project.
In the one dimenionsal approach we considered only the axial strain where as in the case of two dimensionmal we considered both axial and lateral strain. 
we implement this two methods as two different code.
